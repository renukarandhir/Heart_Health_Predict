# # Heart Health Predict  
**Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project uses **machine learning** techniques to predict whether an individual is likely to have **heart disease** based on key medical and demographic indicators. The model is trained on a health dataset containing features such as **age**, **cholesterol levels**, **blood pressure**, and **exercise habits**, helping in early identification of high-risk patients.

   - Handle missing values  
   - Scale numerical features  
   - Encode categorical variables

2. **Model Training**  
   - Train classification models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and others  
   - Tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy

3. **Prediction**  
   - Predict heart disease risk based on new medical records

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Assess model performance using key metrics:  
     - Accuracy  
     - Precision  
     - Recall  
     - F1-Score
